Approach:
Firstly, we conducted an overview of the dataset, followed by the removal of irrelevant columns from the training and testing datasets.
 Subsequently, we performed label encoding on the categorical columns. Next, we addressed the presence of null values within the dataset. 
Moving forward, we proceeded with text processing, which involved removing stopwords and punctuation, resulting in a cleaned text.
 Following this, we applied count vectorization to the "keywords" column to prepare it for model training.
 The dataset was then split into "x" and "y," where "y" included the "taxonomy" and "hcp" features. 
We applied the train-test split to prepare the data for modeling. We constructed a model using the random forest classifier within a multi-output classifier framework. 
The model yielded an accuracy of approximately 83%. Finally, we made predictions on the "x" test data and saved the results in a CSV file.

Feature engineering:
In the given code, feature engineering refers to dropping unnecessary columns from the dataframe.
 This step is performed using the drop() function, which removes columns like 'BIDREQUESTIP', 'USERPLATFORMUID', 'USERZIPCODE', 'USERAGENT', and 'URL'. 
This can be a valid preprocessing step if these columns are deemed irrelevant for the analysis or modeling task at hand.
